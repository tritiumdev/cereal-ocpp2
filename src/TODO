# TODO

This library is actually not complete.

## C++ side

 - There is no special handling of booleans - we just get the native behaviour 
   of Cereal with I believe should conform to the json spec and support only
   true or false. Some back ends may have out of spec implementations
   that send other values, for example with capitalization (e.g. False) or
   integers (e.g. 0 and 1). If this is truly an issue then cereal::boolean
   needs to become a fleshed out struct instead of an alias for the native
   boolean type.

 - There is not yet enforcement of DateTime strings (too little time), they
   are parsed merely as strings. This is critical and should be fixed ASAP.

 - Some of the arrays in the OCPP 2.0 schema have min and max length. This is
   not enforced, but could be easily, by just wrapping a vector and making it
   serializable.. something like this:

   template<size_t MinElems=1, size_MaxElems=4>
   struct size_restricted_vector
   {
       // put cereal helper functions in here... enforcing Min and Max elems
   private:
       vector<...> value_;
   };

 - Probably a few more little issues related to proper expression of the spec.


## On the auto generation Python side:

This is more of a wish list

  - There could be a "schema-to-unit-tests.py" that accompanies the 
    "schema-to-cpp-header2.py" for the auto generation of all the protocol 
    related unit tests you could possible imagine.. In fact u could advocate
    for a unit test driven approach where the we start writing both the unit 
    tests and solve related issues on the C++ side above in parallel. Unit
    test ideas include:

    - Check encoding/decoding correctness - go for maximum coverage.
    - Check exceptions are thrown on invalid enum types.
