# TODO

This library is actually not complete.

## C++ side

 - There is no special handling of booleans - we just get the native behaviour 
   of Cereal with I believe should conform to the json spec and support only
   true or false. Some back ends may have out of spec implementations
   that send other values, for example with capitalization (e.g. False) or
   integers (e.g. 0 and 1). If this is truly an issue then cereal::boolean
   needs to become a fleshed out struct instead of an alias for the native
   boolean type.

 - More thoroughly worked examples showing how the optional fields works and 
   how this code can be deployed into a working product.

## On the auto generation Python side:

This is more of a wish list

  - There could be a "schema-to-unit-tests.py" that accompanies the 
    "schema-to-cpp-header2.py" for the auto generation of all the protocol 
    related unit tests you could possible imagine.. In fact u could advocate
    for a unit test driven approach where the we start writing both the unit 
    tests and solve related issues on the C++ side above in parallel. Unit
    test ideas include:

    - Check encoding/decoding correctness - go for maximum coverage.
    - Check exceptions are thrown on invalid enum types.
